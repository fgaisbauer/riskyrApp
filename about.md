Both the `riskyr` package and the corresponding app are developed by the research group for [Social Psychology and Decision Sciences](https://spds.uni-konstanz.de) at the Social [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany.   


Goal
----

We aim to develop and assemble a set of basic risk literacy tools in R: 

- The `riskyr` package renders risk literacy more transparent by providing a set of computational and representational tools and corresponding visualizations.

- The `riskyrApp` (implemented in R Shiny) allows using `riskyr` in an interactive fashion without any coding.


Status
---------

This app is currently a **prototype** for testing functionalities provided by the `riskyr`package. In a next step, we will extend it and implement a **didactic concept**.

The `riskyr` package is open source software written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and released under the [GPL 2](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2) | [GPL 3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)) licenses.

Please email at <contact.riskyr@gmail.com> in case you want to use, adapt, or share this software.

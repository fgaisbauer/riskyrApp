

Both the package and the app are developed by the working group for [Social Psychology and Decision Sciences](https://spds.uni-konstanz.de) at the Social [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany.   


Goal
----

Develop and assemble a set of basic risk literacy tools in R: 

- The `riskyr` package renders risk literacy more transparent by providing a set of risk literacy tools and corresponding representations.

- The corresponding R Shiny app `riskyrApp` allows using the `riskyr` toolbox in an interactive fashion without any coding.

Status
---------

This app is currently a **prototype for functionalities** provided by the `riskyr`package. In a next step, we will extend it to align to a **didactic concept**.

The `riskyr` package is open source software written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and released under the [GPL 2](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2) | [GPL 3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)) licenses.

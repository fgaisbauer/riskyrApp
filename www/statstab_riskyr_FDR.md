
Analogously to the *PPV*, there also is the **False Discovery Rate** (*FDR*):    


> **The false discovery rate is the percentage of wrong positive decisions out of all positive decisions.**


For example, a cancer screening might yield positive results indicating cancer, although the person who took the test is actually healthy ("false positive").   
The *false discovery rate* is defined as the percentage of people wrongly diagnosed as having cancer ("false positive") out of all people diagnosed of having cancer - both correctly ("true positive") and wrongly ("false positive").   
Indeed, the **false discovery rate** is the "counterpart" of the *positive predictive value* and can be calculated as its complement:


$$FDR = 1 - PPV = \frac{\text{number of false positives}}
{\text{decision positive}} = \frac{\text{number of false positives}}
{\text{number of true positives} + \text{number of false positives}}$$

  
If we plug in the according values from the table above (which can be changed through the inputs on the left), we get:

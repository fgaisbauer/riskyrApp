
Let's consider another important measure, the **Positive Predictive Value** (or *PPV*):

> **The positive predictive value is the percentage of correct positive decisions out of all positive decisions.**

The **positive predictive value** is sometimes also called *precision* (and not to be confused with *accuracy*).

For example, a cancer screening will from time to time wrongly classify healthy persons as having cancer (this is called "false positives").  
The *positive predictive value* (or *precision*) of the test is defined as the percentage of people correctly diagnosed with cancer ("true positive") out of all people diagnosed with cancer - both correctly ("true positive") and wrongly ("false positives").


First, the PPV can be calculated from the table above using the following formula:

$$PPV = \frac{\text{number of true positives}}{\text{decision positive}} = \frac{\text{number of true positives}}{\text{number of true positives} + \text{number of false positives}}$$

Let's plug in the values from the cells in the table above:

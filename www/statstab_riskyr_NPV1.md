First, the NPV can again be calculated from the table above. That is, it describes the $p(\text{condition false} | \text{decision negative})$:

$$NPV = \frac{\text{number of true negatives}}{\text{decision negative}} = \frac{\text{number of true negatives}}{\text{number of true negatives} + \text{number of false negatives}}$$

Let's plug in the values from the cells in the table above:

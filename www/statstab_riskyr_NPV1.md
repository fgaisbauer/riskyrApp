> **The negative predictive value is the percentage of correct negative decisions out of all negative decisions.**


Using again the example of a cancer screening: Sometimes, the test might overlook a person with cancer and will wrongly diagnose him or her as healthy ("false negative").  
The *negative predictive value* (or *precision*) of the test is defined as the percentage of people correctly diagnosed as not having cancer ("true negative") out of all people diagnosed with cancer - both correctly ("true negative") and wrongly ("false negatives").


First, the NPV can again be calculated from the table above:

$$NPV = \frac{\text{number of true negatives}}{\text{decision negative}} = \frac{\text{number of true negatives}}{\text{number of true negatives} + \text{number of false negatives}}$$

Let's plug in the values from the cells in the table above:

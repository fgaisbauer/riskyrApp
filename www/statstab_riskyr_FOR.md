
Analogously to the *NPV*, there also is the **False Omission Rate** (*FOR*):    


> **The false omission rate is the percentage of wrong negative decisions out of all negative decisions.**


Using again the example of a cancer screening: Sometimes, the test might overlook a person with cancer and will wrongly diagnose him or her as healthy ("false negative").  
The *false omission rate* of the test is defined as the percentage of people wrongly diagnosed as not having cancer ("false negative") out of all people diagnosed of not having cancer - both correctly ("true negative") and wrongly ("false negatives"). So it is the percentage of persons being diagnosed as healthy although they have in fact cancer out of all people diagnosed as healthy.

Indeed, the **false omission rate** is the "counterpart" of the *negative predictive value* and can be calculated as its complement:


$$FOR = 1 - NPV = \frac{\text{number of false negatives}}
{\text{decision negative}} = \frac{\text{number of false negatives}}
{\text{number of true negatives} + \text{number of false negatives}}$$

  
If we plug in the according values from the table above (which can be changed through the inputs on the left), we get:

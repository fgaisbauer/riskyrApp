Let's start with **accuracy** (or *ACC*):

> **Accuracy is the proportion of correct decisions out of all decisions made.**

A decision, test, diagnosis procedure, or measurement device is the more accurate, the closer it captures the "true" quantity or number of cases it is supposed to assess.

For example, a cancer screening test should correctly detect those people who actually have cancer (also called "true positives"), but should simultaneously detect people without cancer as being healthy (or "true negatives").

The accuracy of a decision, test, diagnostic procedure, or measurement device, is defined by:

$$ACC = \frac{\text{number of true positives (hi)} + \text{number of true negatives (cr)}}{\text{total population (N)}}$$
  
If we plug in the according values from the table above (which can be changed through the inputs on the left), we get:

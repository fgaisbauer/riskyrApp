### About `riskyr` and the `riskyrApp` 

`riskyr` and the `riskyrApp` originated out of a series of lectures and workshops on risk literacy in spring/summer 2017.   

We aim to develop and assemble a set of basic risk literacy tools in R: 

- The `riskyr` package renders risk literacy more transparent by providing a set of computational and representational tools and corresponding visualizations.   
The current release of `riskyr` is available at <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=riskyr>.

- The `riskyrApp` (implemented in R Shiny) allows using `riskyr` in an interactive fashion without any coding.     
The `riskyrApp` is currently a prototype for testing functionalities provided by the `riskyr`package.    
In a next step, we will extend it and implement a didactic concept.


The primary designers and developers are [Hansjörg Neth](https://www.spds.uni-konstanz.de/hans-neth), [Felix Gaisbauer](https://www.spds.uni-konstanz.de/felix-gaisbauer), and [Nico Gradwohl](https://www.spds.uni-konstanz.de/nico-gradwohl),   
who are researchers at the department of [Social Psychology and Decision Sciences](https://www.spds.uni-konstanz.de) at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/), Germany.


The `riskyr` package is open source software written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and released under the [GPL 2](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2) | [GPL 3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)) licenses.
